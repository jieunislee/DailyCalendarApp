## Summary

- There's a lot of information on smartphones that is unorganized. 
- The aim of this app is to support users to organize and manage their data easily by combining data into days.
- Through Google API, users can link their Google account to bring data into the smartphone and manage a wide range of data. 

## Background and Purpose

There is so much information on our smartphones that humans can't process—this app is designed to organize and recognize information on your phone at a glance. First, the app was developed using Android Studio, and later, the app was redesigned based on the developed app to complete the app with an aesthetic and human-centered design sense.

## Utilization and Value

By linking your Google account with the App through Google API, you can get more user 'day' data. The app organizes the information from your Google account and phone so you can see it at a glance. Then, all you have to do is add the information you want, and you're good to go. Especially since it is designed in a calendar format, it has a great visual effect, so it is suitable for reviewing before starting the day, and it is easy to look back at the past day. We plan to integrate more Google apps such as Google Trips and others in the future.

## Requirements

- Android Studio
- Android API
